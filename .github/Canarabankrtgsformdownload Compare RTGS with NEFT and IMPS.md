- You should check the IFSC code of the beneficiary bank and branch carefully before filling up the RTGS form. A wrong IFSC code can result in a failed or delayed fund transfer.
- You should ensure that you have sufficient balance in your account to cover the amount and charges of the fund transfer. If your account has insufficient funds, your fund transfer request will be rejected.
- You should note down the transaction reference number (UTR) that you will receive after submitting the RTGS form. This number will help you track the status of your fund transfer and resolve any issues if they arise.
- You should inform the beneficiary about the fund transfer and share the UTR number with them. This will help them confirm the receipt of the funds and avoid any confusion.
