## What is pt\_ImportSubtitles v1.7?
 
pt\_ImportSubtitles v1.7 is a script for After Effects that lets you import subtitles into After Effects using either the Encore Text Script, SubRip SRT or WebVTT file formats[^1^]. You can then adjust the font, size and alignment of the subtitles using the Character/Paragraph panels in After Effects.
 
Once you have imported the subtitles, you have two options:
 
- Render the subtitles with an alpha channel and import them into your editing software of choice, such as Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve.
- Use Dynamic Link to import the subtitle comp from After Effects directly into Premiere Pro and edit them along with your video.

pt\_ImportSubtitles v1.7 is compatible with After Effects CC 2019, CC 2018, CC 2017, CC 2015.3, CC 2015, CC 2014, CC, CS6, CS5.5, CS5 and CS4[^2^]. It is also compatible with OpenSesame Server for automated subtitling[^1^].
 
## How to Use pt\_ImportSubtitles v1.7?
 
To use pt\_ImportSubtitles v1.7, follow these steps:

1. Create a new composition in After Effects with the correct format for your output.
2. Create a sample text layer and change the font, size and alignment of the text as required using the Character/Paragraph panels. For example, you may want to set the text alignment to "Center Text". You can then delete the text layer.
3. Run the pt\_ImportSubtitles script from the File > Scripts > Run Script File menu or from the Window menu if you have installed it as a dockable panel.
4. Choose the subtitle format from the drop-down menu in the script UI. You can choose between Encore Text Script, SubRip SRT or WebVTT formats.
5. Click on Import Subtitles and select the subtitle file that you want to import.
6. The script will create a new text layer with the imported subtitles in your composition. You can drag it to the bottom of the comp and use the Title Safe comp guides if necessary.
7. If you want to change the text size or style after importing, select the text layer and modify the settings in the Character/Paragraph panels as needed. Then delete the text layer and use the script to import it again.
8. Depending on your workflow, you can either:
    - Render the subtitles with an alpha channel by choosing a format that supports alpha (such as QuickTime Animation) in the Output Module settings of your render queue. Then import the rendered file into your editing software and place it over your video.
    - Use Dynamic Link to import the subtitle comp from After Effects directly into Premiere Pro by dragging it from AE's project panel into Premiere Pro's project panel. Then place it over your video in your timeline and edit as usual.
