# A Textbook of Environmental Chemistry and Pollution Control PDF: A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Professionals
 <meta name="description" content="Learn about the principles and applications of environmental chemistry and pollution control with this free PDF textbook."> 
Environmental chemistry and pollution control are two interrelated fields that deal with the chemical aspects of environmental problems. Environmental chemistry studies the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the natural environment. Pollution control involves the prevention, reduction, or elimination of pollutants that harm human health or the environment.
