## Use keywords strategically
 
Keywords are the words and phrases that users type into the search engines to find what they are looking for. You should use keywords that match the topic and intent of your article, and that have a good balance between search volume and competition. You can use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs Keyword Explorer to find the best keywords for your article.
 
Once you have your keywords, you should use them in the following places:
 
- The title of your article
- The URL of your article
- The meta description of your article
- The headings and subheadings of your article
- The body of your article
- The image alt text of your article

However, you should avoid keyword stuffing, which means using keywords too many times or in unnatural ways. This can harm your SEO and make your content unreadable. Instead, use keywords naturally and vary them with synonyms and related terms.
